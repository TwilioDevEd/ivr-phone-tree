# IVR Phone Tree with Ruby on Rails and Twilio

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/ivr-phone-tree-rails.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/ivr-phone-tree-rails)

IVRs (interactive voice response) are automated phone systems that can
facilitate communication between callers and businesses. If you've ever dialed
your credit card company to check on a balance after responding to a series of
automated prompts, you've used an IVR. Learn how to build an IVR in minutes
using Twilio's powerful TwiML API.
